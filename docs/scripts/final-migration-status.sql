-- FINAL MIGRATION STATUS COMPLETE
-- =====================================================
-- 
-- If you see 4 triggers, your migration is PERFECT!
-- 
-- The 4 triggers provide:
-- 1. Timestamp updates (when comments are edited)
-- 2. Real-time notifications (for live updates)
-- 3. Vote count management (automatic like/dislike counts)
-- 4. Vote notifications (for real-time vote updates)
-- 
-- This is the optimal setup for a production comment system.
