## **üîß COMMON RESEND ISSUES & SOLUTIONS**

### **1. Domain Verification Issues**
**Problem**: Resend requires domain verification for sending emails
**Solution**: 
- Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/domains)
- Add and verify your domain
- Use a verified domain in your `FROM_EMAIL`

### **2. API Key Issues**
**Problem**: Invalid or expired API key
**Solution**:
- Check your Resend API key in the dashboard
- Ensure it has the correct permissions
- Regenerate if necessary

### **3. FROM_EMAIL Issues**
**Problem**: Using unverified email addresses
**Solution**:
- Use a verified domain email address
- Avoid using Gmail, Yahoo, etc. as FROM_EMAIL
- Use your own domain (e.g., `noreply@yourdomain.com`)

### **4. Rate Limiting**
**Problem**: Exceeding Resend's rate limits
**Solution**:
- Check your Resend dashboard for rate limit status
- Implement proper rate limiting in your application

## **üõ†Ô∏è STEP-BY-STEP FIX PROCESS**

### **Step 1: Run the Diagnostic Tool**
```bash
npm run diagnose:email
```

This will show you exactly what's wrong with your Resend configuration.

### **Step 2: Check Your Environment Variables**
Make sure these are set correctly in your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Primary Email Provider
EMAIL_PRIMARY_PROVIDER=resend
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here

# Email Configuration
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com  # Use your verified domain
FROM_NAME=VulnScope

# Secondary Provider (for fallback)
EMAIL_SECONDARY_PROVIDER=smtp
EMAIL_ENABLE_FALLBACK=true
```

### **Step 3: Verify Your Resend Setup**

1. **Go to Resend Dashboard**: https://resend.com/domains
2. **Check Domain Status**: Ensure your domain is verified
3. **Check API Key**: Verify your API key is active
4. **Check Rate Limits**: Ensure you haven't exceeded limits

### **Step 4: Test with Improved Logging**
After running the diagnostic, try adding a team member again. You'll now see detailed error information that will help identify the exact issue.

## **üéØ QUICK FIXES**

### **Fix 1: Use a Verified Domain**
If you're using Gmail or another common domain, switch to your own domain:

```bash
# Instead of this:
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@gmail.com

# Use this:
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### **Fix 2: Check API Key Format**
Ensure your API key starts with `re_`:

```bash
# Correct format:
RESEND_API_KEY=re_1234567890abcdef...

# Wrong format:
RESEND_API_KEY=1234567890abcdef...
```

### **Fix 3: Verify Domain in Resend**
1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Add your domain
3. Complete DNS verification
4. Wait for verification to complete
