# 🎯 MongoDB Setup Summary

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

Your VulnScope project now has a complete MongoDB data seeding solution! Here's what I've created for you:

### 📁 New Files Created

1. **`src/scripts/seed-all-data.ts`** - Comprehensive seeding script with all collections
2. **`src/scripts/seed-essential-data.ts`** - Essential data seeding for development
3. **`src/scripts/reset-database.ts`** - Database reset utility
4. **`src/scripts/test-seeding.ts`** - Seeding verification script
5. **`docs/mongodb-seeding-guide.md`** - Complete documentation
6. **`docs/mongodb-setup-summary.md`** - This summary

### 🔧 Updated Files

1. **`package.json`** - Added new seeding commands

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### For Development (Recommended)
```bash
# Reset database and seed essential data
npm run db:setup
```

### For Complete Testing
```bash
# Reset database and seed all data
npm run db:setup-full
```

### Individual Commands
```bash
# Reset database only
npm run db:reset

# Seed vulnerabilities only
npm run seed:vulnerabilities

# Seed essential data only
npm run seed:essential

# Seed all data only
npm run seed:all

# Test seeding results
npm run db:test
```

## 📊 What Gets Seeded

### Essential Data (`npm run seed:essential`)
- ✅ **35+ vulnerabilities** with complete metadata
- ✅ **20 user bookmarks** with priorities and tags
- ✅ **50 user activities** with timestamps
- ✅ **10 saved searches** with realistic filters
- ✅ **5 user preferences** with various settings
- ✅ **3 system configurations** for basic setup

### Full Data (`npm run seed:all`)
Everything from essential data plus:
- ✅ **100 notifications** with different types
- ✅ **25 alert rules** with custom conditions
- ✅ **5 collaboration teams** with members
- ✅ **30 team discussions** about vulnerabilities
- ✅ **40 shared vulnerabilities** with team context
- ✅ **Admin system** with users and audit logs
- ✅ **Extended system configuration**

## 🗄️ Database Collections

Your MongoDB will have these collections populated:

| Collection | Essential | Full | Description |
|------------|-----------|------|-------------|
| `vulnerabilities` | ✅ | ✅ | CVE records with full metadata |
| `user_bookmarks` | ✅ | ✅ | User bookmarked vulnerabilities |
| `user_activity` | ✅ | ✅ | User activity logs |
| `saved_searches` | ✅ | ✅ | User saved search configurations |
| `user_preferences` | ✅ | ✅ | User preference settings |
| `system_config` | ✅ | ✅ | System configuration |
| `notifications` | ❌ | ✅ | User notifications |
| `alert_rules` | ❌ | ✅ | Custom alert rules |
| `teams` | ❌ | ✅ | Collaboration teams |
| `discussions` | ❌ | ✅ | Team discussions |
| `shared_vulnerabilities` | ❌ | ✅ | Shared vulnerability data |
| `admin_users` | ❌ | ✅ | Admin user management |
| `admin_audit_logs` | ❌ | ✅ | Admin audit trail |

## 🔍 Verification

After seeding, you can verify everything worked:

```bash
# Test the seeding results
npm run db:test
```

This will check:
- ✅ Collection document counts
- ✅ Data integrity (required fields)
- ✅ Database indexes
- ✅ Sample data validation

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run the setup command**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:setup
   ```

2. **Verify the seeding**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:test
   ```

3. **Start your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Check your application** - You should now see:
   - Vulnerabilities in the dashboard
   - User data in the user sections
   - Team collaboration features
   - Admin functionality

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding Your Own Data
You can easily customize the seeding scripts:

1. **Edit sample data** in the seeding scripts
2. **Add new collections** by extending the scripts
3. **Modify data relationships** by updating helper functions

### Example: Adding Custom Vulnerabilities
```typescript
// In src/scripts/seed-vulnerabilities.ts
const customVulnerabilities = [
  {
    cveId: 'CVE-2024-CUSTOM-001',
    title: 'Your Custom Vulnerability',
    description: 'Description of your vulnerability',
    severity: 'HIGH',
    cvssScore: 8.5,
    // ... other required fields
  }
];

// Add to the vulnerabilities array
vulnerabilities.push(...customVulnerabilities);
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Errors**: Check your MongoDB connection string in `src/lib/mongodb.ts`
2. **Permission Errors**: Ensure your MongoDB user has read/write permissions
3. **Duplicate Key Errors**: Run `npm run db:reset` first
4. **Memory Issues**: Increase Node.js memory limit if needed

### Getting Help

1. Check the detailed guide: `docs/mongodb-seeding-guide.md`
2. Run the test script: `npm run db:test`
3. Check console output for specific error messages
